## Full Description

**Personal 4th Step Inventory - Made by Someone in Recovery, for Recovery**

I created this app for myself to work through AA's 4th Step. This is NOT official AA - just my personal approach to doing a fearless moral inventory. Sharing it freely in case others find it helpful.

**Features:**
✓ Track resentments, fears, and character defects
✓ Organize: What happened, why it bothered me, my part, character defects  
✓ Completely FREE - No ads, subscriptions, or hidden costs
✓ Privacy-first - Data stays on your device unless you choose Google Drive backup
✓ Simple form-based entry for Step 4 work
✓ Export/import CSV files
✓ English and Danish language support
✓ Cross-device sync via optional Google Drive

**Important:**
• UNOFFICIAL tool - not endorsed by AA World Services
• Created by individual in recovery as personal project  
• Always follow your sponsor's guidance for Step 4
• Supplements but doesn't replace traditional methods

**Privacy:**
• Local storage by default
• Optional Google Drive uses private app folder
• No tracking, analytics, or data sharing
• Full control - export, backup, or delete anytime

I made this because pen-and-paper didn't work for me. If you prefer digital tools, this might help your Step 4 process. Will always be free - recovery tools should be accessible to all.

Your sponsor is your best guide. This is just a tool - the real work happens between you, your higher power, and your sponsor.
